						<h2 class="section-heading">Nodes</h2>
						<p>Spook implements various Phantasma standard features in a single easy to use tool. These tools can be leveraged from the SDK allowing developers to setup a full Integrated Development Environment(IDE) locally.<p>
						<p>For development of Phantasma applications it is recommended you run a Phantasma node locally. It acts as your own personal blockchain network.</p>
						<p>To view the code, read the instructions and deploy your own instance of Spook, head over to <a href="https://github.com/phantasma-io/Spook">Github</a>.</p>
