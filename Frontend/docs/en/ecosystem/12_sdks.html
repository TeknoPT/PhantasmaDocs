<h2 class ="section-heading">PhantasmaSDK</h2>

<p>One of the many challenges that blockchain developers face today is lack of tools, documentation and software development kits. In order for this technology to go mainstream, we need to have the resources to help onboard as many developers as we can. We believe that building a blockchain isn't enough, but we need to make Phantasma the most developer friendly blockchain out there - and that's why we created our Phantasma SDKs! </p>

<p>To develop dApps on Phantasma, it is recommended to run a Phantasma node locally. Use either the pre-compiled build of Spook which comes bundled in the official SDK
release or compile yourself from the source available in the official <a href="https://github.com/phantasma-io/PhantasmaSpook">repository</a>.</p>
