<h2 class="section-heading">Governance</h2>
						<p>Phantasma's next generation on-chain governance system removes the need for forks and other known drawbacks that legacy blockchains may experience when changes are required. Phantasma's governance system allows the blockchain rules to be parameterized and edited on-chain, once consensus is reached. Consensus is reached by running a poll among either the block producers or the whole community. The consensus poll operates in one of three different modes:</p>
						<ul>
              <li>Unanimity: every voter must agree on the same result to reach consensus.</li>
              <li>Majority: the majority of voters must agree on the same result to reach consensus.</li>
              <li>Popularity: the result with the highest number of votes will reach consensus.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Consensus is always reached unless the top two (or more) options receive an equal number of votes.</p>
