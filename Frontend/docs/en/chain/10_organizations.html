						<h2 class="section-heading">Organizations</h2>
						<p>Phantasma has builtin support for decentralized organizations. The organization system is used to power <a href="#economy-phantom">Phantom Force</a>.</p>
						<p>An organization behaves similar to an account, and so it is also identified by it's own <a href="#chain-address">address</a>. However the main difference is that it can add other accounts as members of it, and then any operation done by the organization requires signatures from the majority of it's members.</p>
						<p>An organization can also optionally have a contract attached to it, which allows to customize the behaviour of the organization, which includes for example custom rules for members and how the assets are transfered.</p>
						
						<p>For deeper diving, the code implementation of the organization is available at <a href="https://github.com/phantasma-io/PhantasmaChain/blob/master/Phantasma.Blockchain/Organization.cs">Github</a>.</p>
