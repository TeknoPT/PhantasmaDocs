						<h2 class="section-heading">Signatures</h2>
						<p>In blockchain terms, a signature is a piece of pseudo-random data that can be used as mathematical proof (when combined with a public address), in order to verify that another specific piece of data was created by a certain private key that matches the specified public key.<p>
						<p>A signature is what allows users to sign their own <a href="#chain-txs">transactions</a> and then allow nodes to validate their authenticity.</p>
						<p>There are many different algorithm to generate signatures. Phantasma currently supports EdDSA as it's prefered signing scheme, due to it's higher performance. It also supports ECDsa signatures for compatibility with older generation blockchains, like Bitcoin, Ethereum and NEO. <br>
						<p>For deeper diving, the code implementation of a Phantasma signatures is available at <a href="https://github.com/phantasma-io/PhantasmaChain/blob/master/Phantasma.Cryptography/">Github</a>.</p>
