<h2 class="section-heading">Storage</h2>
						<p>Phantasma decentralized storage was designed to enable the deployment of truly decentralized apps and utilize the full power that blockchain technology has to offer. Phantasma decentralized storage uses a file distribution method that makes it possible for developers to deploy dApps which are fully decentralized and hosted on-chain. Therefore, Phantasma dApps are immutable because users simply source the dApp data files from Phantasma's decentralized file storage, not from a website.</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Files on Phantasma's decentralized storage solution are encrypted and distributed across all active block producers and only accessible through controlling a specific private key.</li>
						<li>Every wallet has a specific amount of kilobytes (KB) allocated in proportion to the amount of staked SOUL. Every staked SOUL earns 40 KB of storage, which means that a Soul Master can initially store up to 1.9 GB of data.</li>
