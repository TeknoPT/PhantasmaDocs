						<h2 class="section-heading">Keys</h2>
						<p>Phantasma uses asymmetric cryptography, also called public-key cryptography for most of it's internals. In simple words, this means that for each public key there is an associated private key. The private key is used to generate <a href="#chain-signatures">signatures</a>, that can be used to mathematically verify that an piece of data was generated by someone who knows the private key of a specific public address, without revealing the private key.<p>
						<p>A private key is also the only thing that an user of Phantasma really needs to store in it's own possession, everything else from public key to address and any asset held by the user are stored either in distributed nodes or derived from the private key using mathematical formulas.<br>Software used to manage private keys for users is called a <a href="#chain-wallet">wallet</a>.</p>
						<p>A Phantasma <a href="#chain-address">address</a> is used to encode public keys in a human readable format.<br>
						<p>For deeper diving, the code implementation of a Phantasma key pair is available at <a href="https://github.com/phantasma-io/PhantasmaChain/blob/master/Phantasma.Cryptography/KeyPair.cs">Github</a>.</p>
