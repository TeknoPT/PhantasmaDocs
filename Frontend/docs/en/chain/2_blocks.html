<h2 class="section-heading">Blocks</h2>

<p>A <a href="chain"></a> chain in Phantasma represents a typical blockchain composed of blocks, where each blocks connects to the previous block via a <a href="#chain-hash">hash</a>.<br>The hash of each block is produced from the actual contents of the block, and this together with the linking of the previous block hash is what gives  imutability to a blockchain.<br>In other words, this system ensures that existing data can not be tampered with, making blockchain a unique kind of structure that offers many benefits compared to traditional databases.</p>
<p>Unlike most blockchains who continually generate blocks each X seconds, even if the block is empty, in Phantasma blocks are only generated if transactions are available. This is possible due to the <a href="#chain-consensus">consensus mechanism</a> employed in Phantasma and it helps reducing the storage costs.<br>The time required to generate a new block can be as little as a few seconds, depending only on the amount of pending transactions. A <a href="#spook">Phantasma node</a> can be configured with different periods. When the amount of pending transactions is small, it is more space efficient for a Phantasma node to generate blocks less frequently, but packing each one with more transactions. </p>						
<p>A developer wishing can easily query a <a href="#spook">Phantasma node</a> to obtain information about a specific block, using the available endpoint <a href="#api-GetBlockByHash">GetBlockByHash</a>.</p>
<p>Blocks are also one of Phantasma objects that can be manipulated in raw format via the <a href="#api-GetRawBlockByHash">GetRawBlockByHash</a> endpoint in the REST API.<br>Read more about raw data in the section about <a href="#chain-serialization">serialization</a>.</p>

<p>For deeper diving, the code implementation of a Phantasma block is available at <a href="https://github.com/phantasma-io/PhantasmaChain/blob/master/Phantasma.Blockchain/Block.cs">Github</a>.</p>
