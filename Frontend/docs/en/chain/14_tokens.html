						<h2 class="section-heading">Tokens</h2>
						<p>Phantasma has native support for tokens, which represent the different kinds of assets that a blockchain can use for interact with the real world.</p>
						<p>Tokens can be divided into two categories:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Fungible - Usually represent some kind of monetary unit or quantities of something. Each instance of a fungible token is completly indistinguishable from each other.</li>
						<li>Non-Fungible - A non-fungible represents some kind of unique item, for example a game sword or a web domain. Check the section about <a href="#chain-nft">NFTs</a> for more details.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>For deeper diving, the code implementation of the tokens is available at <a href="https://github.com/phantasma-io/PhantasmaChain/blob/master/Phantasma.Blockchain/Token">Github</a>.</p>
