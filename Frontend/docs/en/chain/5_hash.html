						<h2 class="section-heading">Hash</h2>
						<p>A <a href="chain"></a> address in Phantasma represents a destination for assets.<br>Each address holds a specific balance of <a href="#chain-tokens">tokens</a>, along with several custom data on <a href="#chain-dapps">dapps</a> and builtin <a href="#chain-contracts">contracts</a>.</p>
						<p>Internally an address is a 34 byte array, where the first byte represents address type and the rest of the bytes store a <a href="#chain-keys">public key</a>.</p>
						<p>In order to display it on a human-readable format, those bytes are then encoded using <a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Base58">base58</a> format. The byte representing the address type is manipulated in order to specify the first letter of the human-readable address. This makes it possible to identify the type of address with a quick glance.</p>
												
						<p>The Hash is one of the few non-primitive types that have native support in <a href="#vm-types">Phantasma Virtual Machine</a>.</p>
												
						<p>For deeper diving, the code implementation of a Phantasma hash is available at <a href="https://github.com/phantasma-io/PhantasmaChain/blob/master/Phantasma.Cryptography/Hash.cs">Github</a>.</p>
