<h2 class="section-heading">Validator</h2>
						<p>Phantasma has adopted a variant of proof-of-stake PoS that requires users to have a stake in the network to become a validator (block producer). Validators are then rewarded with a share of the transaction fees. The validators also use a rotational scheduling per side-chain to define who the active block producer is. This process occurs in parallel for each side chain, allowing for horizontal scaling to boost the theoretical transactions per second of the chain. Each validator is responsible for accepting transactions from Phantasma users, verifying signatures & transaction contents. Each type of block producer will be rewarded differently for providing their computational resources to the Phantasma network:</p>
						<ul>
              <li>Active Block Producers - receive 75% of the inflation of the governance token (SOUL), plus a minimum of 25% of the transaction fees for blocks which they validate.</li>
              <li>Standby Block Producers - receive 25% of the daily inflation of the governance token (SOUL). The Phantasma chain will start with 10 active BPs and 15 standby BPs, and the number of total BPs will increase by 3 every year.</li>
            </ul>
