						<h2 class="section-heading">Virtual Machine</h2>
						<p>The core of Phantasma is built with powerful support for flexibility and customization, and this required the creation of a custom virtual machine to execute both <a href="#chain-txs">transactions</a> and <a href="#chain-contracts">contracts</a>.</p>
						<p>The Phantasma Virtual Machine is on a way comparable to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), in a way that both execute custom code that spends <a href="#economy-fees">"gas"</a>, altough Phantasma implementation is separated and built from zero.
						
						<p>To understand the full scope of the virtual machine requires a bit of development experience and some time studying it.<br>There is a <a href="#vm">full section</a> describing the inner works of it.</p>
						
						<p>For deeper diving, the code implementation of the Phantasma Virtual Machine is available at <a href="https://github.com/phantasma-io/PhantasmaChain/blob/master/Phantasma.VM">Github</a>.</p>
