<h2 class="section-heading">Cosmic Swaps</h2>
						<p>Phantasma's cosmic swap framework is an on-chain liquidity solution which allows anyone to connect to this decentralized exchange system and benefit from the same liquidity pool. Cosmic swaps provide token swaps directly in the connected wallets without users having to go to a centralized exchange.</p>
						<p>This framework follows a specific structure for specific wallet addresses to hold a balance of two different tokens. The price of each token is determined by their overall ratio in relation to each other at the current point in time. Users can tap into this address and exchange one of their surplus tokens for the token they require. This decreases the balance of the first token and increases the balance of the second. By having a price mechanism determined by the ratio between the balances in a specific cosmic swap address, any potential arbitrage opportunities that may arise from the difference in price for the tokens in this system will disappear over time as the market will constantly readjust to the equilibrium price level of those tokens across every token exchange provider.</p>
