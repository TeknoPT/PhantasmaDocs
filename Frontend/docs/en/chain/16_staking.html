<h2 class="section-heading">Staking</h2>
						<p>Phatasma staking was designed with ease of use and widespread adoption in mind. Paying all transaction fees in SOUL is not feasible and would be very inefficient. Phantasma designed a dual token system solution whereby users who stake SOUL are eligible to receive rewards in the form of KCAL. KCAL is the network resource token and is used to pay fees on every transaction that happens on-chain.</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Each staked SOUL will earn the user 0.002 kcal per day.</li>
						<li>Users who stake more than 50,000 SOUL will earn the title of Soul Master and earn extra rewards from a pool of 125,000 SOUL every month.</li>
            <li>Soul Masters staking for greater than 90 days will receive a special CROWN NFT every 90 days starting from the time of Phantasma's genesis block. Each CROWN NFT boosts the users KCAL generation rate by 5% up to 100% by having twenty.</li>
            <li>CROWN NFT contains a portion of the ecosystem's total KCAL fees for the last 90 days as well as 20% of the ecosystem incentive allocation, evenly distributed to all qualifying wallets.</li>
						</ul>
