<h2 class="section-heading">Side Chains</h2>
						<p>A dApp running on its own side chain removes the risk that one single dApp could shut down the whole network whenever it's spammed. This gives developers the power they need to build revolutionary dApps with the supported languages C#, Java, Solidity and Python (support for additional programming languages will be added later).</p>
						<ul>
              <li>Phantasma allows infinite side chains to be deployed.</li>
              <li>Main and side chains can validate 10k transactions per block.</li>
              <li>The maximum total transactions per second (TPS) is the amount of side chains plus the main chain multiplied by the maximum TPS of each chain.</li>
              <li>Infinite side chains coupled with the inter-chain technology Phantasma implements in its network allows all chains to be connected.</li>
            </ul>
